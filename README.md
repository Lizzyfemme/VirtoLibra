# VirtoLibra

Initial plan is to make a slack-style platform to engage with the reading community around you.

### Tech Stack

For this project we're using React for our client.
We store all user information in Firebase.
After some technical issues, we migrated our main feed items to an express server that is simply storing that information in JSON files.
Our workflow is organized through Trello and Slack.

### Setup:

- Clone into repo
- Navigate to client folder and run `npm i`
- Navigate back to root directory and run `npm i`
- Run `npm run dev` to start project.
